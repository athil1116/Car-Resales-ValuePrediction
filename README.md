# Car-Resales-ValuePrediction
This project uses machine learning to predict the resale value of a car based on features such as age, mileage, fuel type, transmission, and ownership history. By training regression models on a cleaned dataset, the system provides accurate price estimates, helping buyers and sellers make informed decisions in the used car market.
apply regression models to accurately predict car prices.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset
Imported using pandas.

Initial data checks included:

Checking for missing values using .isna().sum().

Inspecting data types with .dtypes.

ðŸ§¹ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Dropping Columns:

NewPrice column was dropped due to 90% missing values.

An unnamed index column was also removed.

Handling Text in Numeric Columns:

Columns like Mileage, Engine, and Power contained units (e.g., km/kg, cc, bhp).

Used .str.replace() to remove units:

python
Copy
Edit
df['Mileage'] = df['Mileage'].str.replace(' km/kg', '')
Converted cleaned strings to numeric using .astype(float).

Handling Missing Values:

Remaining missing values were filled using:

.fillna() with mean, median, or mode, depending on the column type.

Encoding Categorical Features:

Applied LabelEncoder to convert object-type columns into numerical values.

Feature Selection:

Input features: X

Target variable: y (Car resale price)

Feature Scaling:

Used MinMaxScaler() to normalize features to a common scale:

python
Copy
Edit
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
scaler = MinMaxScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)
ðŸ“ˆ Model Training
Train/Test Split:

Used train_test_split() from scikit-learn.

80% training data, 20% testing:

python
Copy
Edit
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_scaled, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
Linear Regression:

Trained a Multiple Linear Regression model.

Used r2_score to evaluate performance.

Model did not achieve good accuracy.

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regression:

Switched to KNeighborsRegressor due to better suitability for the dataset.

Trained and tested using the same split.

Achieved better r2_score than Linear Regression.

ðŸ“Š Evaluation
Performance measured using r2_score.

KNN outperformed Linear Regression on this dataset.
