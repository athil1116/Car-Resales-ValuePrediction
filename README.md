# Car-Resales-ValuePrediction
This project uses machine learning to predict the resale value of a car based on features such as age, mileage, fuel type, transmission, and ownership history. By training regression models on a cleaned dataset, the system provides accurate price estimates, helping buyers and sellers make informed decisions in the used car market.
